In order to use Python with python-evdev and pymouse in the script you need to install 
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip gcc
$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
$ sudo pip install --system python-evdev
$ sudo pip install --system python-xlib
$ sudo pip install --system pymouse

PS: if you install pymouse and older version will be installed, but it works on the script.
For newer version you need to install PyUserInput which includes PyMouse and PyKeyboard modules.

If you are not sure which events are supported by your device, you can run a script like this to identify your device capabilities:

from evdev import InputDevice, InputEvent, UInput, categorize, ecodes as e
device = InputDevice('/dev/input/event2') # adjust the correct event number
cap = device.capabilities(verbose=True,absinfo=True)
print('Device Capabilities:', cap) 

The device capabilities are printed in the format event type: value1, value2, value3

Similar info can be obtained by using the linux $sudo evtest utility (apt install if missing).

In my ELAN Touch Screen, turned out that EV_KEY type has only value 333=BTN_TOUCH.
My device capabilites do not list BTN_LEFT, BTN_RIGHT.
